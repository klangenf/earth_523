# Analysis for Earth 523

Today, I'm learning how to write in **Markdown**. So far, I've learned that I can:

-Write text describing my analysis
- Embed code with code chunks
- Create HTML, pdf, or word output by specifying in the YAML header

My [github page](https://github.com/klangenf/earth_523) for this analysis.

$y = x^2$

```{r cars_analysis}
head(cars)
str(cars)

plot(cars)

max_speed <- max(cars$speed)
```

The average speed of the cars in the cars dataset is `r mean(cars$speed)` mph. The minimum speed is `r min(cars$speed)` mph. The maximum speed is `r max_speed` mph.
